HA HA HA HA. Now I'm going to write about what the game is about. Like six weeks later. Or maybe it's even seven weeks. Part of this was just because of being busy, but I think it's also pretty clear that there's a resistance to tackling the work of really engaging with the "what is this for?" question. Maybe partly because it's intimidating? I think maybe most of all because you might get an answer you don't like... an anwer like "nothing" and then you have to stop making it.

(Well you don't _have_ to stop, but now that I'm in this academic game full time I feel like I probably shouldn't spend too much time making games that serve no interesting purpose at all. Anyway that's not the case here, because...)

So the game is about remediation I think. And writing it now after so much time away from the game, I may repeat things I've written below, but I think it's a valuable exercise to try to say what it is cold.

It's an extension/follow-up on the Breakout Indies Bungle, where I remediated five indie games into Breakout. This time it's the same exercise, but remediating games into Snake. It also relates to SNAKISMS obviously, because in that case I was remediating (I guess? Maybe not media this time, but another form of translation at least) philosophical ideas into Snake (sometimes purely in a comic way, but sometimes with a genuine desire to be 'accurate').

The reason for making it is in large part to explore, through making, this idea of translation or remediation. Particularly the question of how you make design decisions in this context. You have a source system (the original game, like Tetris, say) and the target system (Snake), and you need to make design 'moves' that result in a version of Snake that 'is like' or even ideally in some sense 'is' the source game. You can't say 'is' really because that doesn't make sense, but the 'likeness' is interesting. Just how similar can such a complete reworking of a game really be? What does it mean to say that one game is like another? (Normally I think we'd be referring to them having the same or very similar mechanics? Doom is like Quake. I doubt you'd say two games were like each other on the narrative axis if they were TOTALLY distinct in terms of gameplay? That's probably an interesting thing to think about? Like if there were a post-apocalyptic match-3 game, would you compare it to Fallout 3? And now I have to make that.)

Okay so it's about examining the notion of translation (maybe I feel more comfortable there than remediation? Although I should re-read remediation texts because I think there might be something interesting to say about individual games as _mediums_ rather than instance of media?). And you examine it by doing it, seeing how you make design decisions, seeing how you _justify_ design decisions, and going from there. Process is very important here, which is why I'm writing this, but why it's also so key that when I'm making them I'm committing with regularity and with explanation.

It's a little weird in the sense that the games are maybe also already designed? I think there's also something weird/interesting to think about in terms of the relative complexities of the source and target? Like Shadow of the Colossus is complex... it has a narrative, detailed visual effects, a horse, a game-feel, etc... and the Snake version... well it's not the same, it's not so detailed? And that's something to think about when we talk about how you can say one represents the other? Is it farcical to even be making these sorts of claims/reaches? Like, sure you can make Snake look "a bit like" Shadow of the Colossus, but what does that mean exactly?

A lot of the juice presumably has to be in the juxtaposition/grafting of the rules and mechanics. The Snake version of Shadow is partially interesting because with think about the movement and life-and-death styles of Snake and how they relate to those things in the context of Shadow?

As with Chogue a big question is just how you decide _which system_ to accept the rule/mechanic from. Should there be a consistently dominant system? Does it depend on certain factors? How can I make myself aware of how those decisions are made?

Given that I've _already designed_ each game to some extent (pre the inevitable changes required by development itself), I guess I could go through and try to justify how it turned out?

I kind of don't like Tetrisss right now? But maybe I should just shut up.

- Chessssss? Haha.

## 2017-08-09 13:57

Ha ha. I was going to write stuff about what the game is about again and again did not. Ha ha. Funny. I'm laughing.

## 2017-08-03 16:22

I have ten now that seem somewhat doable?

- Tetrisss
- Sssensssible Sssoccer
- Ssshadow of the Colossssssusss
- Sssteven'sss Sssausssage Roll
- Papersss, Pleassse
- Sssuper Hexagon
- SSSSSS
- The Witnessssss
- Sssuper Mario Brosss.
- Minesssweeper

BUT, I would suggest to you that SSR, Hexagon, and soccer could all be extremely difficult or just not very successful. Hexagon in particular doesn't seem like a very good idea. So it's probably important to have three in reserve if at all possible. And then to take all the game more toward some paper designing.

- Missssssile Command (ha ha)
- Asssteroidsss
- Msss. Pacman
- Ssspace War!
(Does this lean to heavy on the classic arcade side? Does that tell us something in itself?)

ALSO in the spirit of Jonathan pointing out that in _It is as if you were doing work_ I didn't actually write very much about the actual question, in that case, of speculative play and thinking about evoking thoughts about a near future etc... in the spirit of that, I should probably write at least a little something about the (nascent?) question that this game might be about or might approach?

... I will write this in a bit...

Okay bu... in a bit.




## Gimme some more (2017-07-20 14:11 & 2017-07-21 10:08 & 2017-08-03 16:15)

- Tetrisss

I guess the snake moves around at the bottom and needs to eat the falling Tetris pieces? And you ... lose when the snake dies? Which would be inevitable? Or maybe the snake has to be used to push and rotate pieces (how would you rotate as opposed to just push?) maybe it can ONLY push. Hehe. That's kind of funny.... could be complex, but it could be amazing.

- Sssensssible Sssoccer

Maybe a two player game. Two goals. A ball. Have to push the ball through the goal. If you score you get longer (or maybe opponent does - not sure which would be 'balanced'). Could be fun.

- Ssshadow of the Colossssssusss

There's a big figure on the screen, if you hit it in the wrong place you die. There's a spot you have to eat (the apple) that damages it and then another appears. Har har har. Hee hee. (What happens when it hits your body? I dunno.)

(At this point I guess I want there to be 10 levels ideally? 5 as a bare, bare minimum.)

- Sssteven's Sssausssage Roll

Remediate one of the puzzles (or make one up), the snake pushes the sausages and they roll around. They collide with your body. You have to grill them and get to the end point. Sausages should probably be quite big? (Graphically this doesn't seem like it will work well... if I'm sticking with Snake style graphics then the blockiness will work against anything with detail...)

- Papersss, Pleassse

I don't know how to do this but it feels like it might be too funny? I guess one funny option would be to steal the music and have the snake move like the titles - kind of a lurching through the game. And then ... I'm not quite sure how to (or whether to) add other elements of the game... maybe it's actually just enough... maybe it's about how many of the apples you get? Maybe the purity of the music is a better gag...

- Sssuper Hexagon

I guess shapes fly in from the sides and you try to avoid them? Like a maze moving inwards the whole time to the center? Might be impossible though - you couldn't move sideways? Unless they were far enough apart?

- SSSSSS

(The letter S sssix timesss. HAHAHAHAHA.)

Could be the gravitron? You can move around (bounce off the walls?) an a stream of things come through at you. Plus apples that you can eat. I think it would have to matter whether they hit your body? Or it cuts off your body but then those pieces remain and you collide with them? (May be visually confusing?)





## More furtherer thoughts (2017-07-19 10:27)

Last time I wrote-thought about this game I told myself I should start trying to come up with some of the ways the games could actually work to start getting an understanding of how to actually work with these ideas and to hopefully find the 'identity' of the game through that process. So I guess I will obey past-me's instructions and actually try it out?

SOOOOOOO...

- The Witnessssss

This one seems like one of the easier one's to do a 'proper' remediation just because the core mechanic of The Witness is set on a grid with a snake-like movement through space. Almost too easy (and conceivably a bit boring for that reason?). Essentially this one would be a standard-issue Witness puzzle that you would solve with the Snake. It changes the puzzle because then it's in real-time (I guess this would be even more intense if you generated the puzzles, but that sounds like a total nightmare?). You can crash the snake in the normal way, but also the snake would crash at the end if you haven't solved the puzzle correctly (I guess it would just smash into the final block rather than slithering it's way out). The Witness even has things you effectively 'eat' and those could be used to make the snake longer. So it's basically highly constrained Snake.

- Sssuper Mario Brosss.

Seems roughly okay. Side-scroller with the snake on the ground (like a snake). I guess it could eat the Goomba that it runs into first, get longer, be unable to jump for any of the powerups, and then smash into a pipe and die. Ha ha hardeeharhar. I guess one interesting-ish question is how to represent this all graphically? Because it suddenly occurs to me it might be quite appealing to see this all remediated into the gridded system of normal Snake rather than trying to match the graphics of the source game? Makes my job a lot easier. BUTTTTTT... is this even interesting? SHIT. SHIT. Is it?

- Minesssweeper

You on the Minesweeper grid, starting somewhere (shouldn't have a bomb!) and you 'clear' the squares you eat (and you get longer with each one, so the levels might be insoluble?). If you eat a bomb you obviously die. And when you clear a square the board should react in the way that Minesweeper traditionally does. Basically makes the game harder (similarly to The Witness), except much, much harder because there's no real time to react to the information available and the game has random resets so you wouldn't be able to learn how it works... (is this the thematic, though? Just - oh I turned these games into Snake and now they're all bullshit and impossible? IS THAT EVEN INTERESTING? It's still kind of an interesting formal exercse?)


## Further thoughts (2017-07-14 13:46)

I'm in Hawaii and this game isn't exactly on my mind, but I did do a couple of drawings in the notebook to think about what the screens might look like. (See screenshots or whatever.) While I was drawing those I ended up feeling like I was quite unclear on what the core of the game was, and was getting confused between some different possibilities which would really mean different things about how the game should look and feel...

- The real _bungle_ idea would be that the games are kind of terrible 'versions' of the games they reference. In that case they would need to be bad. They would need to be, I guess, kind of cursory treatments of the origin game using the medium of snake... so kind of lame by design.
- Another idea would be an actually serious attempt to _remediate_ the games into Snake - actually try to figure out how the basic Snake mechanisms could be used to actually try to recreate the spirit or appearance or something of those origin games. But an actual attempt to say it's "the same game" in some sense.
- Finally, I could try to _reimagine_ the games with Snake. So rather than trying to use Snake to represent them in a kind of rigid way, reimagine Snake around the ideas from the origin game.

These all have their recommendations. Obviously I won't call it a bungle if it's not the bungled approach. It's okay to make a game called Sibilant Snakelikes without the bungle concept. That would create, I guess, a more general idea of remediation based games (in one way or another they're all oriented toward remediation).

The Bungle approach would in theory be the easiest because it would be bad on purpose.

I'm not totally clear on whether it's funny? The Breakout Indies bungle was weird because those games were kind of serious attempts to remediate the games? Well, within the specific mechanics of breakout. They weren't really 'bungled' in the sense of being badly done, they were bungles in terms of... what? I mean I guess just the bungle of making a game on the wrong 'platform' or something.

hm hm hm hm.

Anyway, anyway, anyway, hm, anyway, hm, anyway, hm.

It's fine. It'll be fine. We're fine, we're doing fine.

I guess I should just come up with a bunch of actual mechanical ideas for the snakelikes (rather than just the hilarious sibilant names) and then see what the overall situation feels like. Feel it out through the actual design.


## Early days (2017-07-09 12:02)

Was talking to Rilla about this project again at breakfast at Hof Kelsten and it occurs to me I should really write some words down about it and start the repo etc. so that I have a record of it from the early days - notably if this is going to be useful from the perspective of our larger Research Creation project.

The genesis of the idea in this case was... hmm, I'm forgetting the precise details. It was definitely about bouncing ideas back and forth with Rilla. The title "Sibilant Step Siblings" came out of us joking around. And then in the mix was this idea of reimagining various games by adding 's'es to their titles and using that as a reason it would be made as a Snake-like version of it.

So the brief here is, as you might imagine: remediating existing games into Snake. Much as Indie Bungle 2 reimagined indie games as Breakout.

There's something to be said (and perhaps seriously written) about this idea of __remediation within a medium__? Or rather the idea that the fact this seems/feels like remediation suggests almost the idea of individual __games as mediums__? It would be worth re-engaging with the remediation book/literature and perhaps making this case through research creation? Anyway that's a thread to follow moving forward.

So along with that I have the twin issues of

- A title for this thing
- A set of games to remediate

As such here are some attempts at those things...

### Games to snakify

(Looking at this it seems like adding a triple 's' for a single is a decent rule to follow - I'd imagined that doubles would do it, but they don't quite look essy enough.)

- The Witnessssss
- Fesss (a cheat on a 'z', but funny to pronounce)
- The Sssimsss
- Sssuper Mario Bros.
- Minesssweeper
- Dear Esssther
- Gran Turisssmo
- Tetrisss
- Dark Sssoulsss
- The Ssstanley Parable / The Beginner'sss Guide < That is pretty funny with the possessive, there are probably other games with a possessive of course
- Ssspace Quessst
- Candy Crush Sssaga
- Shadow of the Colossssssusss
- The Lassst of Usss
- Sssensssible Sssoccer
- ...

### Naming

- Sibilant Step Siblings < The original, but I worry it's a bit too silly for a game that is ostensibly taking itself a bit seriously...
- Snakeses
- Bungle 3: Sss
- Snakelikes < This is a contender...
- Bungle 3: Snakelikes
- Snakelikes (An XXXX Bungle)
- Sssnakelikesss

The 'bungle' aspect of this is proving difficult to like.

- Snakelike Bungle
- The Sibilant Snakelike Bungle < Getting better?
- Sibilant Snakelikes Bungle

Hmmm. Okay well maybe The Sibilant Snakelike Bungle is pretty good? It's a shame Bungle doesn't start with an S. Pretty hard to make it do that though, ultimately. I .... okay there was some distraction there while I figured out that this computer's x key is not always responsive if I hit it in the lower left quadrant. Something I'll keep an eye on. Apparently it's a pretty seriously common problem with these computers (with this butterfly mechanism). Replacements are being done. Feeling annoyed about Apple and their expensive shit right now. Expensive. With an xx. It typed that double x just then on its own. This is not a nice thing to be running into. Think about how often I type x when I'm programming. Hm. Well it's not fixable prior to going to Hawaii so I guess I'll have this slightly below par x until then.

The Sibilant Snakelikes Bungle.

How's that?

x?

xx?

Hmm.
