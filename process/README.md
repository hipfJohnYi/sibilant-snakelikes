Was talking to Rilla about this project again at breakfast at Hof Kelsten and it occurs to me I should really write some words down about it and start the repo etc. so that I have a record of it from the early days - notably if this is going to be useful from the perspective of our larger Research Creation project.

The genesis of the idea in this case was... hmm, I'm forgetting the precise details. It was definitely about bouncing ideas back and forth with Rilla. The title "Sibilant Step Siblings" came out of us joking around. And then in the mix was this idea of reimagining various games by adding 's'es to their titles and using that as a reason it would be made as a Snake-like version of it.

So the brief here is, as you might imagine: remediating existing games into Snake. Much as Indie Bungle 2 reimagined indie games as Breakout.

There's something to be said (and perhaps seriously written) about this idea of __remediation within a medium__? Or rather the idea that the fact this seems/feels like remediation suggests almost the idea of individual __games as mediums__? It would be worth re-engaging with the remediation book/literature and perhaps making this case through research creation? Anyway that's a thread to follow moving forward.

So along with that I have the twin issues of

- A title for this thing
- A set of games to remediate

As such here are some attempts at those things...

### Games to snakify

(Looking at this it seems like adding a triple 's' for a single is a decent rule to follow - I'd imagined that doubles would do it, but they don't quite look essy enough.)

- The Witnessssss
- Fesss (a cheat on a 'z', but funny to pronounce)
- The Sssimsss
- Sssuper Mario Bros.
- Minesssweeper
- Dear Esssther
- Gran Turisssmo
- Tetrisss
- Dark Sssoulsss
- The Ssstanley Parable / The Beginner'sss Guide < That is pretty funny with the possessive, there are probably other games with a possessive of course
- Ssspace Quessst
- Candy Crush Sssaga
- Shadow of the Colossssssusss
- The Lassst of Usss
- Sssensssible Sssoccer
- ...

### Naming

- Sibilant Step Siblings < The original, but I worry it's a bit too silly for a game that is ostensibly taking itself a bit seriously...
- Snakeses
- Bungle 3: Sss
- Snakelikes < This is a contender...
- Bungle 3: Snakelikes
- Snakelikes (An XXXX Bungle)
- Sssnakelikesss

The 'bungle' aspect of this is proving difficult to like.

- Snakelike Bungle
- The Sibilant Snakelike Bungle < Getting better?
- Sibilant Snakelikes Bungle

Hmmm. Okay well maybe The Sibilant Snakelike Bungle is pretty good? It's a shame Bungle doesn't start with an S. Pretty hard to make it do that though, ultimately. I .... okay there was some distraction there while I figured out that this computer's x key is not always responsive if I hit it in the lower left quadrant. Something I'll keep an eye on. Apparently it's a pretty seriously common problem with these computers (with this butterfly mechanism). Replacements are being done. Feeling annoyed about Apple and their expensive shit right now. Expensive. With an xx. It typed that double x just then on its own. This is not a nice thing to be running into. Think about how often I type x when I'm programming. Hm. Well it's not fixable prior to going to Hawaii so I guess I'll have this slightly below par x until then.

The Sibilant Snakelikes Bungle.

How's that?
